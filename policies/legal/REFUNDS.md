# Refund Policy (Credits)

**Last updated:** 2025-12-28

Spuric.ai sells **digital credits** that are used inside the Spuric platform to access features and services (“Credits”). Credits are **not a subscription**, and they have no cash value outside of Spuric.

---

## 1) All sales are final
**All Credit purchases are final and non-refundable**, except in the limited situations below or where refunds are required by law.

---

## 2) Limited exceptions
We may issue a refund or correction if:

- **Duplicate charge / billing mistake:** You were charged more than once for the same purchase, or the amount charged was incorrect.
- **Unauthorized payment:** You believe your payment method was used without your permission (contact us immediately).
- **Service failure at purchase:** The Credits were purchased successfully but were **not delivered to your Spuric account** within a reasonable period.

In these cases, we may refund the payment, correct the charge, or credit your account—whichever is appropriate.

---

## 3) Chargebacks
If you file a chargeback, your Credits and access may be temporarily suspended while we investigate. We encourage you to contact support first so we can resolve the issue quickly.

---

## 4) How to request help
Email support with:
- The email on your Spuric account
- Date/time of purchase
- Amount charged
- Any receipt/transaction info (the Stripe email is fine)

**Support:** support@spuric.ai *(replace with your real support email)*

## 5) Required by law
Nothing in this policy limits any rights you may have under applicable law. If a refund is required by law, we will comply.
